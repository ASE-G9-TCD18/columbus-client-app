    <p><b>Project 3: Journey Sharing</b>
      The goal of this project is to develop an app for travellers to find compatible fellow-travellers to share a journey with two modes.
      One mode is a search for travellers to share a daily commute. The second mode is to find compatible travellers in real-time.
      For example, when leaving a concert stadium, or queueing at a busy taxi-rank, find compatible people who share the same objectives
      (e.g., travelling roughly in the same direction) and where each traveller will feel safe (e.g., only women).
      Most likely, the group will share a taxi, and the group needs to book a taxi, and arrange for payment.
      The group may also choose to walk together (e.g., a small group of people may feel safer walking a short distance together,
      than doing so by themselves). Selection of travellers for the group may take reputation into account,
      and after each trip, each traveller should “rate” fellow travellers.
      A journey route should be devised taking all final destinations into account.




     The columbus appplication allows users to commute with fellow passengers.
